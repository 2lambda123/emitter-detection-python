# Python Companion to Emitter Detection and Geolocation for Electronic Warfare

![Textbook cover](https://us.artechhouse.com/Assets/ProductImages/5645_t.jpg "Emitter Detection and Geolocation for Electronic Warfare")

This repository is a port of the [MATLAB software companion](https://github.com/nodonoughue/emitter-detection-textbook/) to *Emitter Detection and Geolocation for Electronic Warfare,* by Nicholas A. O'Donoughue, Artech House, 2019.

The textbook can be purchased from **[Artech House](https://us.artechhouse.com/Emitter-Detection-and-Geolocation-for-Electronic-Warfare-P2052.aspx)**.


# REWRITE THE REST OF THIS README ONCE THE CODE IS DONE

## Installation

Simply open the folder in MATLAB or add the root folder containing this repository to the MATLAB search path.  Clone this repository, or download the latest release from the Mathworks File Exchange.

## Figures

To generate the figures in the book, execute the script **runAll.m**

*Warning: Some of the figures are generated through a Monte Carlo simulation that can take several hours to complete.  For this reason, the variable **force_recalc** is set to False, which will skip any figures that were generated with a lengthy simulation.  To generate those figures, set force_recalc=True.*

Alternatively, one can call one of the chapter specific scripts in the folder make_figures, such as:

    force_recalc=True;
	make_figures/ch1_drawFigures;

The output will be stored in the **figures/** folder.

## Examples
The **examples/** folder contains the code to execute each of the examples in the textbook.

## Homework
The **hw/** folder contains data sets used for two homework problems in Chapter 8.

## Utilities
A number of utilities are provided in this repository, under the following namespaces:

+ **aoa/** Code to execute angle-of-arrival estimation, as discussed in Chapter 7
+ **array/** Code to execute array-based angle-of-arrival estimation, as discussed in Chapter 8
+ **atm/** Code to model atmospheric loss, as discussed in Appendix Carlo
+ **detector/** Code to model detection performance, as discussed in Chapter 3-4
+ **fdoa/** Code to execute Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA) geolocation processing, as discussed in Chapter 12.
+ **hybrid/** Code to execute hybrid geolocation processing, as discussed in Chapter 13.
+ **noise/** Code to model noise power, as discussed in Appendix D.
+ **prop/** Code to model propagation losses, as discussed in Appendix B.
+ **tdoa/** Code to execute Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) geolocation processing, as discussed in Chapter 11.
+ **triang/** Code to model triangulation from multiple AOA measurements, as discussed in Chapter 10.
+ **utils/** Generic utilities, including numerical solvers used in geolocation algorithms.
